00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,070
Provenance Widgets is an open source

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,710
library of modular UI control elements

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,590
such as range sliders, select dropdowns,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,310
and checkbox groups. This library tracks

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,430
the recency and frequency of a user's

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,590
provenance and presents them back to the

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,710
user via dynamically overlaid

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,270
visualizations. Let me show you how:

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,310
Consider this range slider. If I interact

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,150
with it a few times by changing the

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,670
ranges, our library will add visual scents

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,870
at the top, showing an aggregated summary

13
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,030
of what has happened so far.

14
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,637
By default, the color corresponds to

15
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,757
recency and the height corresponds to

16
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:36,437
frequency.

17
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,206
Clicking on that little footprints icon

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,406
reveals a detailed temporal evolution

19
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:43,406
showing which ranges have been selected

20
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,406
so far, and when. I can filter a subset

21
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,206
of these selections by brushing the Y-axis.

22
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,726
I can also revisit any

23
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,446
selection by simply clicking on the

24
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,886
points or the rectangles corresponding to

25
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:56,766
that selection. Let's take another

26
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,606
example. This is a single select dropdown

27
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,004
If during the course of analysis I end up

28
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:03,684
selecting different cities such as New

29
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,324
York, Rome and London, the library can

30
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,804
visually tell me each options

31
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,684
interaction, recency and frequency.

32
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,056
In the detailed view, it can tell me

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,976
exactly when I selected a particular

34
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:21,576
option. Here it looks like London was

35
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,376
consistently selected throughout the

36
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:26,336
analysis and Istanbul was not selected at

37
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,856
all. Just like before, I can filter my

38
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,896
interaction provenance using this range

39
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,456
slider and revisit any state by clicking

40
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:35,416
on the rectangle representing that state.

41
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:39,185
Provenance widget supports a variety of

42
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,505
UI controls like single sliders, multi

43
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:44,025
select drop downs, radio button groups,

44
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:46,785
checkbox groups and text inputs. The

45
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,385
library is open sourced and available at

46
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,345
github.com/ProvenanceWidgets.

47
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,785
We hope our library helps application

48
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:57,185
developers build custom provenance aware

49
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,305
systems with ease.
